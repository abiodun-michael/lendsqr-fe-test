# Lendsqr FE Test

This is a frontend assessment for frontend role at Lendsqr.

<a href="https://abiodun-michael-lendsqr-fe-test.vercel.app/">Live Demo</a>

## Stack Used:

React, NextJs, TypeScript, SCSS

## Reason for Stack:

The instruction manual for the role specifically mentioned that React, TypeScript and SCSS be used. However, React have gone through many improvement and they now recommened NextJS as a go-to framework ontop of their amazing library for ease of development, routing, enforcement of styles, SEO and SSR. I used the latest version of both React and NextJs while adhering to best practices.

Refer to React's recomendation manual using the following link:
